## Runtime comparison

Sample runs were run on Diabetes10000.csv from ninja 
Training was performed on 10000 row and training was tested on another 10000 rows. 

| Algorithm         | Train Time    | Test Time | Output Image | 
| ----------------- |:-------------:| ---------:| ------------ |
| KNN               | kmeansright-aligned | $1600 |  |
| Mini Batch KMeans | centered      |   $12 |  |
| KD-Tree           | are neat      |    $1 |  |
