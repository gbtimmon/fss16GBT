We plan to implement / deploy / examine the techniques or some subset of techniques for data driven effort estimation in the Paper 

Karel Dejaeger, Wouter Verbeke, David Martens, and Bart Baesens, "Data Mining Techniques for Software Effort Estimation: A Comparative Study" in IEEE Transactions On Software Engineering, Vol. 38, No. 2, March/April 2012

and compare the results of these techniques one a specific or possible various datasets. We would be looking in particualar at finding a correlation between various types of datasets and which esitmation techniques are effective with each type. We hope to draw insights on what techniques to choose based on the nature of the data being examined.
