## Plan

We plan to implement / deploy / examine some subset of techniques for data driven effort estimation in the Paper listed above.  Compare the results of these techniques on various datasets. We would be looking in particualar at finding a correlation between various types of datasets and which esitmation techniques are effective with each type.  We will attempt to exapnd the original paper by finding effective metrics of the dataset which we can then use to apply the discretization techniques present in class to derive which factors of the data are significant in determining the best technique to apply. With this we hope to draw insights of when a particular technique is not appropriate.
