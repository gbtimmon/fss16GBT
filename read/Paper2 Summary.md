##Keywords
* SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle. A conceptual model used in project management to describe the stages involved in an information system development project.
* Waterfall: A linear-sequential SDLC model. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
* Spiral: A combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model. It allows for incremental releases of the product or refinement through each iteration around the spiral.
* RAD: SDLC model based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved
* Incremental:A method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally, till the product is finished.
