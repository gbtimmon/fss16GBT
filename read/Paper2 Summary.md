##Keywords
* SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle. A conceptual model used in project management to describe the stages involved in an information system development project.
* Waterfall: A linear-sequential SDLC model. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
* Spiral: A combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model. It allows for incremental releases of the product or refinement through each iteration around the spiral.
* RAD: SDLC model based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved
* Incremental:A method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally, till the product is finished.

##Summary
###Introduction
This paper lists three categories of considerations to be made while choosing a particular SDLC model. A number of models including Waterfall, incremental and RAD are discuused.

* Category 1. Software that provides back-end functionality.Typically, this is software that provides a service toother applications.
* Category 2. Software that provides a service to an end-user or to an end-user application. Typically, this would be software that encapsulates business logic or formats data to make it more understandable to an end-user.
* Category 3. Software that provides a visual interface to an enduser. Typically, this is a front-end application that is a graphical user interface (GUI)
