##Keywords
* SDLC: Software Development Life Cycle. A conceptual model used in project management to describe the stages involved in an information system development project.
* Waterfall: A linear-sequential SDLC model. Each phase must be completed before the next phase can begin and there is no overlapping in the phases.
* Spiral: A combination of iterative development process model and sequential linear development model. It allows for incremental releases of the product or refinement through each iteration around the spiral.
* RAD: SDLC model based on prototyping and iterative development with no specific planning involved
* Incremental:A method of software development where the model is designed, implemented and tested incrementally, till the product is finished.

##Summary
###Introduction
This paper lists three categories of considerations to be made while choosing a particular SDLC model. A number of models including Waterfall, incremental and RAD are discuused.

* Category 1. Software that provides back-end functionality.Typically, this is software that provides a service to other applications.
* Category 2. Software that provides a service to an end-user or to an end-user application. Typically, this would be software that encapsulates business logic or formats data to make it more understandable to an end-user.
* Category 3. Software that provides a visual interface to an enduser. Typically, this is a front-end application that is a graphical user interface (GUI)

It also states that SDLC can be of three types: iterative, linear or a combination of linear and iterative.
### Models
* Waterfall: Also called cascade model, it has a clear flow from specifications, to design and coding, development and testing, to deployment and evaluation. Waterfall model requires various documents. Quality assurance is higher since each stage incorporate verification. Very efficient fro Category 1 softwares.
* B-model: Extension to Waterfall model, contains an extended operational life cycle attached to the original waterfall. It provides for better constant improvement and alternative to obsolete softwares spin offs into newer softwares. Suited to Category 1.
* Incremental : Iterative version of waterfall. Advantages- feedback can be incorporated, early incremental releases, monitored changes.
* V-model : A variation of the waterfall model in a V shape folded in half at the lowest level of decomposition. Suited for Category 1. Modified model vee++ for all categories. It can be used for large projects, and with large number of stakeholders.
* Spiral : Solves issues in Waterfall model- two design stages are unnecessary, top down approach along with look-ahead approach, identification of risks and issues. Advantage- control risks and costs. Best suited to Category 1 but can be modified for all categories. Disadvantage- requires flexible project and relies on designer's risk analysis.
* Unified Process Model: Model(or architechture) based and use-case driven. Developed for OOPs. Suitable for Category 2 and 3 projects. Not ideal for large systems.
* RAD: Rapid Application Development. It is a way to deliver projects faster and iteratively. Promotes a collaborative atmosphere where business stakeholders participate actively in prototyping, creating test cases and performing unit tests. RAD is now used as a generic term for a number of techniques ofr speeding the software development.

i) Agile: Projects are divided into sub-projects to avoid issues with changes. Short interval development to small incremental changes. Applying Agile to large projects can be problematic because it emphasizes real-time communication. Most suited to Category 3.

ii) Extreme Programming (XP): Development takes place incrementally and fast with a business champion acting as a conduit for user-driven requirements and functionality. Costs may be higher, if new requirement changes are done. 

iii) Lean Development (LD): Deliver projects early with minimal functionality.

iv) Scrum: Development takes place over a series of short iterations, or sprints, and progress is measured daily. Scrum is more suited to small projects.

All RAD techniques are well suited to category 3 but not to Category 1 and 2 due to lack of a formal procedural approach.

### Conclusion and Future
SDLC can evolve and borrow from other spheres such as behavior analysis, time management, and business management. Agile is based on behavior analysis. Suggestions are made for a central repository of SDLC models which can help project development in a number of ways. 

This paper introduces Rapid Application Development, a few methodologies and comparisons to traditional models. The advantages in temrs of speed and change requirement handling is explained. It forms the basis for how and when to choose such models and when to avoid them for various reasons.

Improvements: There could be more of a comparison between models, based on metrics, or a clearer list of advantages and disadvantages.
