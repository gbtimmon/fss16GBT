## Keywords
a) Data Mining: process of analyzing data from different perspectives and summarizing it into useful information.

b) Software Effort Estimation: Process of predicting the time and effort required to accomplish development or maintenance tasks.

c) Regression: Test if previously developed and tested software still performs correctly even after it was changed or interfaced with other software. 

## Introduction
Resourse planning for software companies includes computing power and personnel effort. Estimates of effort can help management improve planning of personnel. In this paper, 13 techniques are investigated, including tree/rule-based models, linear models, nonlinear models, and a lazy learning-based approach. Effort estimation is done by taking in details of the new account and then comparing it to past data using relevant metrics. New data intensive models are supercedeing older formal or expert based models. 

## Research of Techniques
The paper has researched various machine learning approaches to effort estimation, along with statistical information. A table in the paper shows a number of researches done over the years, but points out that it is difficult to reproduce and verify.
