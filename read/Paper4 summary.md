## Summary
### Introduction
In the above paper, the authors explain why predictive models are required and how they may be chosen with the help of examples. there is often a trade-off between the predictive accuracy of powerful but essentially black box models such as neural networks or support vector machines and the good interpretability of other types of representations that may facilitate validation by an analyst or domain expert.
This makes rule induction algorithms, like decision tree learners viable since they have goof interpretability, along with black box rule extrations such as neural networks and support vector machines, to extract a set of rules. There is little understanding of the factors influencing comprehensibility and that there have been no attempts to show e.g. that users actually prefer certain visualizations over mere textual representations. Hence, he argues that data mining can benefit considerably from the interaction with cognitive science to increase the usefulness of knowledge discovery and the user's acceptance of the models obtained. More specifically, an end-user experiment was set up to test the accuracy, response time, and answer confidence for a set of problem-solving tasks involving these representations.

### Conclusion
An end-user experiment was designed to test the accuracy, response time, and answer confidence for a set of problem solving tasks involving the former representations, of a number of alternative predictive model representations, i.e. decision tables, decision trees, propositional rules,and oblique rules. The paper concludes that on a lot of accounts, decision tree proves to be the most significant advantages. 
A majority of the users found decision tables the easiest representation format to work with. further collaboration between the data mining and cognitive science communities is recommended to create algorithms and representations that are both predictive as well as comprehensible.
