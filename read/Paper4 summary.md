## Summary
### Introduction
In the above paper, the authors explain why predictive models are required and how they may be chosen with the help of examples. there is often a trade-off between the predictive accuracy of powerful but essentially black box models such as neural networks or support vector machines and the good interpretability of other types of representations that may facilitate validation by an analyst or domain expert.
This makes rule induction algorithms, like decision tree learners viable since they have goof interpretability, along with black box rule extrations such as neural networks and support vector machines, to extract a set of rules. There is little understanding of the factors influencing comprehensibility and that there have been no attempts to show e.g. that users actually prefer certain visualizations over mere textual representations. Hence, he argues that data mining can benefit considerably from the interaction with cognitive science to increase the usefulness of knowledge discovery and the user's acceptance of the models obtained. More specifically, an end-user experiment was set up to test the accuracy, response time, and answer confidence for a set of problem-solving tasks involving these representations.

### Rule representation
- if-then rules

IF (INCOME N 400 AND GOAL=CAR) THEN ACCEPT
IF (INCOME N 900 AND GOAL=HOUSE) THEN ACCEPT
DEFAULT:REJECT

### Theory development and propositions
In this paper, it is assumed that the models are automatically generated by running a data mining or machine learning algorithm on a given data set of observations and the focus is on comprehensability. The ability to better understand a model will increase task performance.
#### Propositions: 
- Representation size. : Larger representaation size, lower accuracy and confidence, and longer answer times. In this paper, the respondents were instructed to answer both fast and accurately, with no specific priority for either goal.
- Spatial tasks. : Graphical representations, decision tables and decision trees, achieve a better performance on spatial tasks than textual representations.
- Symbolic tasks. : All three representation formats achieve similar performance on simple symbolic tasks. For larger symbolic tasks, decision trees and tables outperform the textual description. The usefulness of Symbolic task performance is discussed.
- Oblique rules. : Even for simple models, the observed task performance will be low and it will decrease as representation size increases.

### Research
They emperically tested the representation formats using a computerized experiment. The experiment tested Propositions 1 to 3 using a 2×3×7 within-subjects experimental design. Representation size consisted of seven different levels, the representation format factor has three levels (textual representation, decision trees, and decision tables), while the task type factor has two levels, i.e. classification (cf.symbolic) and logical (cf. spatial) tasks. A homogenous group of people were used to conduct the test. The task performance measures consisted of three elements:accuracy, answer time, and answer confidence. The computerized test consisted of a short introduction, the experiment, and a post-experiment survey. 

### Results
It was assumed that the graphical representations, i.e. trees and tables, either have equivalent or better performance than the textual description on both symbolic and spatial tasks. Whereas this assumption proved correct for decision tables, the results are more mixed for decision trees.In spite of the excellent performance of decision tables in this study, there seems to be a lack of learning algorithms for this representation format.Performance of the textual description is therefore expected to be even worse for multi-class problems. Furthermore, the study confirms the negative impact of representation size on comprehensibility. 


### Conclusion
An end-user experiment was designed to test the accuracy, response time, and answer confidence for a set of problem solving tasks involving the former representations, of a number of alternative predictive model representations, i.e. decision tables, decision trees, propositional rules,and oblique rules. The paper concludes that on a lot of accounts, decision tree proves to be the most significant advantages. 
A majority of the users found decision tables the easiest representation format to work with. further collaboration between the data mining and cognitive science communities is recommended to create algorithms and representations that are both predictive as well as comprehensible. 

### Improvements
More details on the actual experiment (the Questions and representations) would give a better understanding of how they were tested. More numerical results on the propositions in each term should be given. I would've given more explanation on why they decided decision trees worked best.
