## Introduction
We have been studying effort estimation, its methods and application of data mining techniques to the same. This paper talks about feature selection and parameter optimizations and how it affects the results. The paper proposes to use Genetic Algorithm (GA) to improve prediction performance.
Machine learning techniques use data from past projects to build a regression model that is subsequently employed to predict the effort of new software projects. Two factors substantially influence the accuracy and computation time of machine learning techniques: 
(1) the choice of the input feature subset
(2) the choice of the parameters values of machine learning techniques
