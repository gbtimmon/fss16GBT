## Index Terms: 
- Data mining -  Data mining is the process of analyzing data and summarizing it into useful information. Data mining software is one of a number of analytical tools for analyzing data. 
- Clustering - The process of organizing objects into groups whose members are similar in some way. It is an important unspervised learning problem.
- Defect Prediction - Software development effort estimation is predicting the most realistic amount of effort required to develop or maintain software.

## Introduction
This paper addresses the question of what is best way to reason with data. It is focused on the source of the data and implicitly the applicability of the lessons derived by the models for defect prediction or effort estimation.
